# Analysis-Of-Crime-Data-
Programming language: Python, Spark and MongoDB This project is an analysis on South Australia's crime data from 2010 to 2019. MongoDB was used as a data source with Spark dataframe used to hold the data from the database along with Python's Matplotlib to construct the visualisations. 


Note: The csv file which I've used for this project is too large so it cant be uploaded on Github.
